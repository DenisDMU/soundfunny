## Description
Soundfunny is a web-based project that aims to provide a fun and interactive experience with sounds.
I initially created this project to learn about DOM elements and to experiment with my cringy ideas.
It brings back nostalgia from my early learning days, seeing how far I've come since then. We all start somewhere!

"One step in the right direction, two steps into the cringe."
